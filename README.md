### Virtual Zoom Guesture
In this project, we use 2 hands to zoom in and out the image using OpenCV.
First, start using my built in camera and put the image in the video.
Then I check 2 hands are in the video and check the index and thumb fingers of both hands.
Moving hands closer and wider can zoom in and out.
